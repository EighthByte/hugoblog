#Usage
Here's how to use it

## How the directories work
content stored in /public is where the static website is built
content stored in /static always gets built into public (we have images and CNAME there at the moment)
themes are stored in /themes/
blog posts are stored in /content/post
contig.toml stores configuration

##Start local server to see changes live in browser (from within working directory)
config.toml must have base url set to /eighthbyte.com but when building to deploy needs to be set back to //eighthbyte.com for gh-pages to work properly

run command
hugo server --watch --buildDrafts --verbose

##Create new post with autogenerated meta (haven't tested)
hugo new -t hugo-theme-casper post/my-post.md

##Build for deployment
run command 'hugo' from within projects root directory

##Read readme within /themes/hugo-theme-casper for more info (not a totally accurate source)
